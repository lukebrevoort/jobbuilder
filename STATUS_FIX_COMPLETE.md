# ðŸŽ‰ JobBuilder Status Fix - Complete!

## What Was Fixed

### The Problem
Your Notion database was using a **native Status property** (type `status`), but our code was trying to handle it as a simple `select` property. This caused the error:
```
Status is expected to be status.
```

### The Solution
1. **Detected Your Status Property Structure**:
   - Type: `status` (native Notion status property)
   - Available options: "Not started", "Applied", "In progress", "Done"
   - Organized in groups: To-do, In progress, Complete

2. **Fixed Status Property Handling**:
   - Updated `NotionService.update_job_status()` to properly handle `status` type properties
   - Added status mapping to match your available options
   - Fixed status retrieval in `get_job_status()` to read `status` type properties

3. **Changed Default Status**:
   - Changed from "Generated" (which doesn't exist in your options) to "Applied"
   - This makes logical sense - when application materials are generated, the job moves to "Applied" status

## Status Mapping
The system now automatically maps common status names to your Notion options:

```python
"Applied" â†’ "Applied"
"In Progress" â†’ "In progress" 
"Complete" â†’ "Done"
"Completed" â†’ "Done"
"Not Started" â†’ "Not started"
"Done" â†’ "Done"
```

## How Your System Works Now

### 1. Webhook Trigger
When you add/update a job in your Notion database, it triggers the webhook.

### 2. Data Extraction
The system extracts:
- **Job Title** (from "Job Title" property)
- **Company Name** (from "Company Name" property) 
- **Job Description** (from "Job Description" property)

### 3. AI Generation
- Creates a personalized cover letter
- Customizes your resume for the specific job

### 4. PDF Creation
- Generates professional PDF documents
- Saves them with timestamps: `cover_letter_CompanyName_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.pdf`

### 5. Notion Update
Updates your Notion entry with:
- **Status**: "Applied" 
- **Application Generated**: âœ… (checkbox)
- **Generated Date**: Current date
- **Generated Files**: List of generated PDF filenames

## Testing Your Fixed System

### Option 1: Add a New Job Entry
1. Go to your Notion database
2. Add a new job with Job Title, Company Name, and Job Description
3. The webhook should trigger automatically
4. Check Railway logs to see the processing

### Option 2: Update an Existing Entry
1. Edit the Job Description of an existing job
2. This should trigger the webhook
3. Watch for the status change to "Applied"

### Option 3: Manual Webhook Test
```bash
curl -X POST https://jobbuilder-production.up.railway.app/webhook/notion \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "data": {
      "id": "test-id",
      "properties": {
        "Job Title": {
          "type": "title",
          "title": [{"plain_text": "Software Engineer"}]
        },
        "Company Name": {
          "type": "rich_text", 
          "rich_text": [{"plain_text": "Test Company"}]
        },
        "Job Description": {
          "type": "rich_text",
          "rich_text": [{"plain_text": "Test job description"}]
        }
      }
    }
  }'
```

## Your Notion Database Schema

Your current database properties:
- **Job Title**: `title` type
- **Company Name**: `rich_text` type  
- **Job Description**: `rich_text` type
- **Status**: `status` type with options:
  - "Not started" (red)
  - "Applied" (green) 
  - "In progress" (blue)
  - "Done" (green)
- **Application Generated**: `checkbox` type
- **Generated Date**: `date` type
- **Generated Files**: `rich_text` type

## Alternative: Changing to Multi-Select

If you prefer simpler status handling, you could change your Status property to `multi_select` type:

1. Go to your Notion database
2. Click on the Status column header
3. Change property type to "Multi-select"
4. Add options: "Not Started", "Applied", "In Progress", "Complete"

The code already supports multi_select, so it would work immediately.
