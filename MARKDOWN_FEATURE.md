# Markdown Output Feature

## Overview

The JobBuilder now supports **markdown output** as the primary method for generating job application materials. This replaces the previous PDF-only approach and provides better integration with Notion.

## Why Markdown?

‚úÖ **Native Notion Support**: Content is directly viewable and editable in Notion  
‚úÖ **No Download Issues**: No need to download files - everything is accessible in Notion  
‚úÖ **Better User Experience**: Immediate viewing, editing, and copying  
‚úÖ **Mobile Friendly**: Works perfectly on all devices  
‚úÖ **Version Control**: Notion's built-in versioning works with the content  
‚úÖ **Easy Sharing**: Share via Notion's native sharing features  

## How It Works

1. **Job Processing**: When a job is processed, the system generates:
   - A markdown-formatted cover letter
   - A markdown-formatted resume customized for the job

2. **Notion Integration**: The system creates two child pages under your job entry:
   - `Cover Letter - [Company Name]`
   - `Resume - [Company Name]`

3. **Rich Formatting**: The markdown includes:
   - **Headers** for section organization
   - **Bold text** for emphasis
   - **Bullet points** for skills and achievements
   - **Links** for GitHub/LinkedIn profiles
   - **Horizontal rules** for visual separation

## Configuration

Set the output format using the `OUTPUT_FORMAT` environment variable:

```bash
# Use markdown (recommended)
OUTPUT_FORMAT=markdown

# Use PDF (legacy)
OUTPUT_FORMAT=pdf
```

Default: `markdown`

## Sample Output Structure

```bash
DEBUG=true python -m app.main
```
